    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Moby Builder Toolkit, specifically in the Interactive Containers API, where entitlement checks are not adequately validated, caused by a missing privilege check in a GRPC endpoint when called using a custom syntax format. This flaw allows the currently running privileged container to leverage its elevated privileges, such as full Linux capabilities, to break out of the container and achieve complete host root command execution. This issue may lead to container escape to the underlying host OS when building an image using a malicious Dockerfile or upstream image (for example, when using FROM). \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability can only be exploited when a container execution is part of the build steps of another container. Additionally, an attacker needs to trick a user or process into processing an malicious Buildkit frontend. For these reasons, this flaw was rated with an important severity.\nThe risk of this vulnerability is to systems which build containers. It could have significant consequences to an organization's ability to release new versions of their software.\n            MITIGATION: Do not use BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.",
