    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Microprocessors use a ‘load port’ subcomponent to perform load operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU’s pipelines. Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing side-channel. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue. Updates will be released as they become available. For additional information, please refer to the 'Vulnerability Response' URL.",
