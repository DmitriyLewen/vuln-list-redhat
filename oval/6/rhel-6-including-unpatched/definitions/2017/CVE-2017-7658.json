    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented with two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that authorization. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of jetty embedded in the nutch package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5. The nutch service is not exposed, as such exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Low. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nData Grid 7 has deprecated the agent-bond utility that permits this flaw; it is disabled by default and is no longer supported. While the functionality is still available for backward-compatibility usage, customers are strongly recommended to use Prometheus JMX instead. As the functionality is deprecated and no longer supported, the flaw has been scored as Moderate for Data Grid 7.\n\nData Grid 8 is not affected by this flaw.",
