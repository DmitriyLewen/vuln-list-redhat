    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: With a specially crafted WebP lossless file, libwebp may write data out of bounds to the heap. The ReadHuffmanCodes() function allocates the HuffmanCode buffer with a size that comes from an array of precomputed sizes: kTableSize. The color_cache_bits value defines which size to use. The kTableSize array only takes into account sizes for 8-bit first-level table lookups but not second-level table lookups. libwebp allows codes that are up to 15-bit (MAX_ALLOWED_CODE_LENGTH). When BuildHuffmanTable() attempts to fill the second-level tables it may write data out-of-bounds. The OOB write to the undersized array happens in ReplicateValue. \n            STATEMENT: This security issue has been classified as having an Important security impact. Desktop users are at a high risk of exploitation of this flaw with very minimal interaction. It may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources.\n\nCustomers using this application, which does server-side image processing by linking to the libwebp library, are also potentially impacted by this flaw and are advised to update to the fixed versions of the package.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
