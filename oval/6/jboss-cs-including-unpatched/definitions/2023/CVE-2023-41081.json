    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, such as when a configuration included \"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\" but the configuration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
