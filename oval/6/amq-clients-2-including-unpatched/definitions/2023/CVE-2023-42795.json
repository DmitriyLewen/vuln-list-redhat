    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat. Tomcat may skip, after an error, the recycling of the internal objects that the next request/response process might use, resulting in information leaking from one request to the next. This flaw allows a malicious user to have access to this information. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this as a Moderate impact as the confidentiality is not fully compromised and the malicious user does not have confirmation over the scenario to replicate the error and capture the possible jeopardizing response.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigation is currently available for this flaw.",
