    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Keycloak, where it does not properly validate URLs included in a redirect. This issue could allow an attacker to construct a malicious request to bypass validation and access other URLs and sensitive information within the domain or conduct further attacks. This flaw affects any client that utilizes a wildcard in the Valid Redirect URIs field, and requires user interaction within the malicious URL. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Build of Quarkus is not impacted as this CVE affects the server-side Keycloak execution, but Quarkus only acts as a Keycloak client in its quarkus-keycloak-authorization extension. For this reason, Quarkus is marked as having a Low impact.\n            MITIGATION: No current mitigation is available for this vulnerability.",
