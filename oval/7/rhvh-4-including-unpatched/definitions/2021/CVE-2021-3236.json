    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Vim in the ex_buffer_all function in the src/buffer.c file. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into processing a specially crafted file to trigger the NULL pointer dereference, causing the application to crash. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact because the user has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n            MITIGATION: Do not run untrusted vim scripts as it's not recommended.",
