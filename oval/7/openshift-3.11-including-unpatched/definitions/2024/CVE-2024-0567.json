    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: No description is available for this CVE. \n            STATEMENT: The issue is marked as moderate because it involves a vulnerability in GnuTLS, specifically affecting Cockpit, which utilizes GnuTLS. The vulnerability arises when a certificate chain with distributed trust is rejected during validation using cockpit-certificate-ensure. Although this flaw could potentially be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a denial of service attack on the client, it's important to note that specific server configurations are required for client authentication requests.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
