    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. The internal fork of Commons FileUpload packaged with Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included an unreleased, in progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but failed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from disk creating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the disk being full. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this flaw as a Moderate impact as this would depend on how much information an attacker has over the environment (version and disk for example, increasing Attack Complexity) as there is no guarantee the attack is successful. \nThis may affect only scenarios where running an application on Windows.\n            MITIGATION: No current mitigation is yet available for this flaw.",
