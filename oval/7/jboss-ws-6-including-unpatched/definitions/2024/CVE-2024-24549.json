    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Denial of Service due to improper input validation vulnerability for HTTP/2 requests in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 request, if the request exceeded any of the configured limits for headers, the associated HTTP/2 stream was not reset until after all of the headers had been processed.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M16, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.18, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.85, from 8.5.0 through 8.5.98.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M17, 10.1.19, 9.0.86 or 8.5.99 which fix the issue.\n\n \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability presents a important severity issue due to its potential to facilitate various forms of attack, particularly in the context of HTTP/2 protocol. By delaying the reset of HTTP/2 streams until after processing all headers, malicious actors can exploit this window to execute header manipulation attacks, leading to potential data exfiltration, injection of malicious content, or server resource exhaustion. Furthermore, the delayed reset prolongs the exposure time of vulnerable systems, increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
