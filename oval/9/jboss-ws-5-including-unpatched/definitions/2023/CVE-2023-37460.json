    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Plexus Archiver. While using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting, an archive might lead to arbitrary file creation and possible remote code execution (RCE). Extracting an archive with an entry in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist will bypass the directory destination verification. \n            STATEMENT: There are factors beyond the attacker's control. For example, the victim's server must have an incomplete SSH server configuration by not having the \"~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" existent and also having an SSH Server Port externally accessible. So, an attacker would need, even in other scenarios, to gather configuration settings and previous knowledge about the environment in order to have a successful attack. The impact is Important as code execution might happen, but it is not guaranteed.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigations are available for this issue.",
