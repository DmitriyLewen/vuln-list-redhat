    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the handling of multiplexed streams in the http/2 protocol. A client can repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and then immediately send a RST_STREAM frame to cancel them. This creates extra work for the server setting up and tearing down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for maximum number of active streams per connection, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. \n            STATEMENT: nginx:\nFor performance and resource consumption reasons, nginx limits the number of concurrent streams to a default of 128. In addition, to optimally balance network and server performance, nginx allows the client to persist HTTP connections for up to 1000 requests by default using an HTTP keepalive (see keepalive_requests). By relying on the default keepalive limit, nginx prevents this type of attack. \n\n*Some aspects of this flaw are still under investigation. This page will be updated as soon as details are available.*",
