    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in httpd. Backend applications whose response headers are malicious or exploitable may allow information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF) or local script execution. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw can only be exploited by backend applications via malicious or exploitable response headers.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
