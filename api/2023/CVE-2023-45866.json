  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Bluetooth HID Hosts in BlueZ may permit an unauthenticated Peripheral role HID Device to initiate and establish an encrypted connection, and accept HID keyboard reports, potentially permitting injection of HID messages when no user interaction has occurred in the Central role to authorize such access. An example affected package is bluez 5.64-0ubuntu1 in Ubuntu 22.04LTS. NOTE: in some cases, a CVE-2020-0556 mitigation would have already addressed this Bluetooth HID Hosts issue.",
    "A flaw was found in the HID Profile in BlueZ that opens doors for unauthorized connections, especially by devices like keyboards, to inject keystrokes without user confirmation. BlueZ lacks proper restrictions on non-bonded devices, creating a risk for attackers that are physically close to inject keystrokes and execute arbitrary commands when the device is in a discoverable state."
