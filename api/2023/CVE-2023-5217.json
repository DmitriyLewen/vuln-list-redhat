    "Heap buffer overflow in vp8 encoding in libvpx in Google Chrome prior to 117.0.5938.132 and libvpx 1.13.1 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libvpx, a library used to process VP8 and VP9 video codecs data, processes certain specially formatted video data via a crafted HTML page. This flaw allows an attacker to crash or remotely execute arbitrary code in an application, such as a web browser that is compiled with this library."
