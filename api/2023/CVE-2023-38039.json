  "details": [
    "When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API. However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series of headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.",
    "A flaw was found in the Curl package. Curl allows a malicious server to stream an endless series of headers to a client due to missing limit on header quantity, eventually causing curl to run out of heap memory, which may lead to a crash."
