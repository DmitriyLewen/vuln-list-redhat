  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in ArgoCD, where it failed to properly validate the user-controlled tar.gz file uploaded to the repo-server component. As a result, a maliciously crafted tar.gz file sent by a low-privileged user may result in resource starvation and further denial of service of the ArgoCD server. Additionally, the lack of permissions checking for the inner files in the tar.gz file may lead to an attacker creating files that cannot be further deleted from the server."
