To process files with a directory traversal pattern, a command line flag could be introduced like it was done for GNU cpio.\nUsers can specify on the BusyBox cpio command line which file name should be unpacked, which should be safe as long as no directory traversal is included in that file name argument.\nUser may also consider using another cpio implementation or may ensure that archive files are trusted.",
