    "Apache ActiveMQ is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network access to a broker to run arbitrary shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol to cause the broker to instantiate any class on the classpath. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3, which fixes this issue.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache ActiveMQ, specifically the OpenWire Module. This flaw may allow a remote malicious user to run arbitrary shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol, causing the broker to instantiate any class on the classpath. This issue happens when OpenWire commands are unmarshalled, without validating the provided throwable class type, which could allow an attacker to jeopardize the entire server."
