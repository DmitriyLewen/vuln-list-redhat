    "An issue was discovered in Libreswan 3.x and 4.x before 4.12. When an IKEv1 ISAKMP SA Informational Exchange packet contains a Delete/Notify payload followed by further Notifies that act on the ISAKMP SA, such as a duplicated Delete/Notify message, a NULL pointer dereference on the deleted state causes the pluto daemon to crash and restart.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in the Libreswan package. When an IKEv1 ISAKMP SA Informational Exchange packet contains a Delete/Notify payload followed by further Notifies that act on the ISAKMP SA, such as a duplicated Delete/Notify message, a NULL pointer dereference on the deleted state occurs. This flaw allows a malicious client or attacker to send a malformed IKEv1 Delete/Notify packet, causing a crash and restarting the libreswan pluto daemon. When sent continuously, this could lead to a denial of service attack."
