When enabling remote access to the control channel’s configured TCP port, care should be taken to limit such access to trusted IP ranges on the network level, effectively preventing unauthorized parties from carrying out the attack described in this advisory.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the Bind package. The code that processes control channel messages sent to named calls certain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size. Depending on the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing named to terminate unexpectedly."
