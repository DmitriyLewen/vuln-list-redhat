  "details": [
    "In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints can be incompletely applied. When destination constraints are specified during addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints are only applied to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple keys.",
    "A flaw was found in OpenSSH. When specifying destination constraints while adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys, the constraints only apply to the first key even in cases where the token returns multiple keys."
