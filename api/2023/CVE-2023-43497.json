  "details": [
    "In Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier, processing file uploads using the Stapler web framework creates temporary files in the default system temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files, potentially allowing attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the files before they are used.",
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins weekly and LTS due to an issue when processing file uploads using the Stapler web framework. By sending a specially crafted request, a local authenticated attacker could bypass security restrictions and access the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the files before they are used."
