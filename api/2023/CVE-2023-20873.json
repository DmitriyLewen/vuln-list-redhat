    "In Spring Boot versions 3.0.0 - 3.0.5, 2.7.0 - 2.7.10, and older unsupported versions, an application that is deployed to Cloud Foundry could be susceptible to a security bypass. Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.6+. 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.11+. Users of older, unsupported versions should upgrade to 3.0.6+ or 2.7.11+.",
    "A flaw was found in Spring Boot. This targets specifically 'spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure' package. This issue occurs when an application is deployed to Cloud Foundry, which could be susceptible to a security bypass.\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:\n* You have code that can handle requests that match /cloudfoundryapplication/**. Typically, this will be if there is a catch-all request mapping which matches /**.\n* The application is deployed to Cloud Foundry.\nAn application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n* The application is not deployed to Cloud Foundry\n* You have disabled Cloud Foundry actuator endpoints with management.cloudfoundry.enabled set to false.\n* Your application does not have handler mappings that can handle requests to /cloudfoundryapplication/**."
