    "Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier creates a temporary file in the system temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files when installing a plugin from a URL, potentially allowing attackers with access to the system temporary directory to replace the file before it is installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.",

By sending a specially crafted request, a local authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system.A flaw was found in Jenkins weekly and LTS due to an issue creating a temporary file in the system's temporary directory with default permissions.
