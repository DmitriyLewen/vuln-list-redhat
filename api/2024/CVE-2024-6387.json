  "statement": "Red Hat rates the severity of this flaw as Important. Although there is a possibility of remote code execution, there is a high bar of complexity required. Exploitation relies on an unpredictable race condition, necessitating a huge number of attempts to overcome. If the attacker doesn't achieve such win, the most likely outcome is the sshd server will crash, only impacting availability. Defenders have significant opportunity to utilize network monitoring tools to detect and disrupt this category of exploit due to the large volume of connections required. All actively supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux have ExecShield (aka ASLR) enabled by default and utilize NX technology, significantly reducing reliability of this attack.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9 is the only version which is is affected. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 all utilized an older version of OpenSSH which never incorporated the regression.",
