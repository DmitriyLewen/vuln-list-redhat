  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in ncurses through v6.2-1. _nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c has a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "A heap overflow vulnerability was discovered in the ncurses package, specifically in the terminfo entry-description compiler (tic). The flaw arises from the absence of proper bounds checking during input processing. Exploiting this boundary error, an attacker can craft a file, trick the victim into opening it with the affected software, and trigger an out-of-bounds write, posing a risk to system availability."
