  "details": [
    "In swtpm before 0.4.2 and 0.5.x before 0.5.1, a local attacker may be able to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack against a temporary file such as TMP2-00.permall.",
    "A flaw was found in swtpm. This flaw allows an attacker to create a symbolic link with the name of the temporary file (TMP2-00.permall for TPM 2) and have this point to a valuable file, which will get overwritten by swtpm. The success of the attack depends on the attacker having access to the TPM's state directory (--tpmstate dir). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
