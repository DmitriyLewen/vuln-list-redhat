  "mitigation": "/etc/sudoers within the container should use the `secure_path` option to prevent the PATH environment variable from being modified. However, this will not prevent other possibly dangerous environment variables from being changed. Ideally, the `setenv` option would be removed from /etc/sudoers altogether, and `env_keep` could be used for any safe environment variables that do not introduce security holes.\nTo avoid container compromises resulting in host compromise, avoid using privileged containers; prefer adding individual capabilities as needed.",
